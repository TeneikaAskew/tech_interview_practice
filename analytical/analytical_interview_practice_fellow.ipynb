    "**Business Context.** DS4A is the first scalable, actionable solution for corporations to build diverse and inclusive workforces. Data Science for All (DS4A)/ Empowerment is a virtual data analytics training and jobs program, made available for free to qualifying students and professionals from underrepresented communities, providing new pathways to economic opportunity in the world’s fastest-growing industries. Empowerment is the largest and most innovative program ever to open doors for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and LGBTQ+ students and professionals through data fluency training and career opportunities. Currently, less than 7% of data professionals identify as Black or Latinx, and significant structural barriers prevent many from acquiring data skills. Data Science for All has grown from an idea to a movement, with nearly 40,000 applications and thousands of graduates around the world- people are starting to notice. With the help of our Employer Partners, we are on track to provide 10,000 endowed scholarships over the next three years. Empowerment currently has 22 Employer Partners bridging the opportunity gap to the data-driven jobs of tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Data Science for All would not be possible without support from Employer Partners. So far, we have partnered with dozens of new Employer Partners. If we added up all the endowed scholarship commitments from each Employer Partner, and only admitted Fellows whose training was paid for by partners, only 350 Fellows could partake in DS4A Empowerment and DS4A / Women annually. **How can we start to understand how shares of Empowerment ads on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook drive sponsor acquisition or referrals?**"
